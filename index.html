                    2030 FIFA World Cup by the Congress of the International Federation of
                    Association Football (FIFA), which convened on Wednesday in an
                    extraordinary session via videoconference.</p><br>
                    <p class="text-left">During this session, chaired by FIFA President
                         Gianni Infantino from Zurich, the Congress members also approved
                        the allocation of the three centennial matches in 2030 to Uruguay,
                        Argentina, and Paraguay, while Saudi Arabia was confirmed as the 
                        host nation for the 2034 World Cup.</p><br>

                    The three bids were unanimously approved by the 211 FIFA member association
                    s, who voted separately on the designation procedure adopted by FIFA and the
                     respective bids.
                    In a speech on this occasion, Mr. Infantino stated, "In today’s divided world
                     (...) being able to agree on something like this represents an extraordinary message."</p><br>
                    <p class="text-left">
                      "We live unity. We live inclusivity. We live football," he solemnly declared.
                      For his part, the President of the Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF),
                      Fouzi Lekjaa, expressed his gratitude to the FIFA member associations for
                      making possible “this moment of shared happiness, a moment significant in many
                      ways, starting with its universal representation, rarely seen or experienced

                    to jointly organize the 2030 FIFA World Cup,"
                    he said in a pre-recorded speech broadcast during
                    the Congress.</p><br>

                    "This trust placed in my country by selecting its bid

                    the progress made both in the preparations specific to

                    of the event but also to the realization of what we have always
                    advocated—that sport, in general, and football, in particular,
                     serve as a lever for socio-economic and human development,"
                    he continued.</p><br>
                    <p class="text-left">
                    "The tripartite bid will secure a significant place in history.
                    This is the first time this global event is being held
                    simultaneously in Africa, the cradle of humanity, and on the
                    Old Continent, Europe," concluded the FRMF President.</p><br>

                             Moreover, a representative from the independent auditor (BDO), tasked by
                            FIFA with verifying the compliance of bids for the 2030 and 2034 World Cups,
                            concluded that both bidding procedures were conducted with "objectivity, integrity,
                             and transparency."</p><br>
                          <p class="text-left">
                            As the sole candidate for the 2030 World Cup, the Morocco-Portugal-Spain bid,
                            "Yalla Vamos 2030," achieved a major milestone at the end of November with
                            the publication of FIFA's evaluation report. The report highlighted that this 
                            tripartite bid is characterized by "its overall quality" and exceeds "the minimum
                            organizational requirements" specified in the technical evaluation,
                            earning a score of 4.2 out of 5.

                            <p class="text-left">
                              This strength is evident in the technical evaluation, which covers both infrastructure
                               (sporting and otherwise) and commercial potential, as explained in the report.
                              The Morocco-Portugal-Spain 2030 bid proposes a diverse and appealing selection of 
                              stadiums, numbering 20 in total: six in Morocco, three in Portugal, and 11 in Spain.</p><br>
                              <p class="text-left">
                                This surpasses the minimum requirements (14 stadiums) defined for the 2030 World Cup,
                                 offering enough flexibility to select iconic and diverse venues across the three countries.
                                  The report notes that stadiums such as Santiago Bernabéu in Madrid, Camp Nou in Barcelona,
                                   and the Grand Stade Hassan II in Casablanca have been proposed for the opening and final matches.
